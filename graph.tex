\chapter{Using Graph Convolutional Networks}
While sorting and normalizing are processing steps that may partially aid in inferring attributes about classifiers, they are not able to fundamentally understand the architecture of the classifier. {\color{RubineRed} Need experiment here.} In order to exploit the additional information we have about the architecture, we need a more intelligent design.

One way to address this issue is to change the representation of the classifier from a flat vector to that of a graph, with different neurons being the nodes, connected to each other with directed weighted edges and having an inherent bias feature. However, we also need a machine learning construct which will be able to deal with graphs and Graph Convolutional Networks do just that.
